-   `ewbabynames`: For each year from 1996 to 2020, the number of
    children of each sex given each name in England and Wales. All names
    with more than 3 uses are included. Provided by the UK Office of
    National Statistics.

    children of each sex given each name in Northern Ireland. Provided
    by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.

    children of each sex given each name in Scotland. Provided by the
    National Records of Scotland.

-   `ukbabynames`: Each of the above datasets is bound into one dataset
    with an added nation column based on which dataset it came from.

-   `rankings`: A longitudinal dataset containing the top-100 baby girl
    and top-100 baby boy names over the period 1904 to 1994, only in
